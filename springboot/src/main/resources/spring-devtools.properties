# Customizing Restart Behavior
# You can customize the restart behavior by configuring the spring-devtools.properties file in the src/main/resources directory. For example, to exclude certain paths from triggering a restart:
# Exclude specific paths
## restart.exclude=static/**,public/**

# Include specific paths
## restart.include=**/*.java
